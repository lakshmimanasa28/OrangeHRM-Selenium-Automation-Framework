# QualityHR: Enterprise HRMS Automation Framework

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains a production-grade **Selenium-Java** automation framework developed for the **QualityHR** (OrangeHRM) platform. It automates the high-stakes employee lifecycle—from PIM record creation to leave entitlement and final leave assignment with administrative approval.

The framework utilizes a **Strict Page Object Model (POM)** and custom synchronization strategies to handle complex AJAX-based HRMS environments.

## 📅 Project Execution Timeline (Agile Sprint)

This project was delivered under an intensive execution cycle to resolve deep synchronization issues:

* **Phase 1 (Setup):** Framework skeleton design, Maven dependency management, and BasePage utility development.
* **Phase 2 (PIM & Data):** Developed the Employee Management Module. Implemented dynamic ID generation to ensure zero data conflicts.
* **Phase 3 (Logic & Sync):** Developed the Leave & Entitlement Module. Resolved "Invalid Employee" bugs using Keyboard Event Injection (ARROW_DOWN + ENTER).
* **Phase 4 (Reporting):** Integrated Extent Reports 5, implemented TestNG Listeners for failure screenshots, and finalized the 5/5 pass regression suite.

## 🛠 Framework Key Features
* **Smart Synchronization:** Strictly eliminated flaky Thread.sleep() calls in favor of Explicit Waits and JS-Executor.
* **Dynamic Data Binding:** Automated selection of auto-suggestive dropdowns via a custom Retry-Loop mechanism.
* **Self-Healing Locators:** Shifted from fragile index-based XPaths to robust Attribute-and-Label-based locators.
* **Proof of Execution:** Integrated automated Extent Reports with timestamped logs and pass/fail dashboards.
